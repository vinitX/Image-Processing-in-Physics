# Image-Processing-in-Physics
Image Processing is used in a multitude of applications in Physics. From Astronomy to High-energy
Physics, image processing plays a crucial role in experimental physics. In High-Energy Physics, the
experiments rely on detectors, devices that allow recording of signals originating from particles that
have been generated in collisions, and which pass at relativistic speed in some medium. Signals
are stored locally before they are forwarded to supercomputers for analysis. The signals are then
digitized, analyzed and eventually recorded on more permanent storage for analysis in high-level
computers. In these experiments, the Image Processing is conducted in real-time. Another wide
application of Image Processing is seen in Astronomy. The high-quality images of celestial bodies
captured by telescopes are processed using different image processing techniques. Different machine
learning algorithms are used to sort different celestial bodies. There have been a recent advance
in the field of astronomical data processing which has enabled the creation of high-quality colored
astronomical images. In the field of Condensed Matter Physics, experiments are conducted to
capture microscopic images using Scanning Tunneling Electron Microscopy. The image generation
takes hours to scan the atomic configuration of nano-scale materials. Huge 2D image data is
generated and the next step is to process that data and identify different microscopic domain
structures. Recently scientists have been the detection of Skyrmions on 2D magnetic material
which is the future of data storage solutions
